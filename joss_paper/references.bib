  abstract = {Imbalances in glutamatergic (excitatory) and GABA (inhibitory) signalling within key brain networks are thought to underlie many brain and mental health disorders, and for this reason there is considerable interest in investigating how individual variability in localised concentrations of these molecules relate to brain disorders. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a reliable means of measuring, in vivo, concentrations of neurometabolites such as GABA, glutamate and glutamine that can be correlated with brain function and dysfunction. However, an issue of much debate is whether the GABA observed and measured using MRS represents the entire pool of GABA available for measurement (i.e., metabolic, intracellular, and extracellular) or is instead limited to only some portion of it. GABA function can also be investigated indirectly in humans through the use of non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques that can be used to measure cortical excitability and GABA-mediated physiological inhibition. To investigate this issue further we collected in a single session both types of measurement, i.e., TMS measures of cortical excitability and physiological inhibition and ultra-high-field (7 T) MRS measures of GABA, glutamate and glutamine, from the left sensorimotor cortex of the same group of right-handed individuals. We found that TMS and MRS measures were largely uncorrelated with one another, save for the plateau of the TMS IO curve that was negatively correlated with MRS-Glutamate (Glu) and intra-cortical facilitation (10ms ISI) that was positively associated with MRS-Glutamate concentration. These findings are consistent with the view that the GABA concentrations measured using the MRS largely represent pools of GABA that are linked to tonic rather than phasic inhibition and thus contribute to the inhibitory tone of a brain area rather than GABAergic synaptic transmission.},

The mechanisms and neurochemical substrates underlying TUS neuromodulation in humans and how these relate to excitation and inhibition are still poorly understood. In 24 healthy controls, we separately stimulated two deep cortical regions and investigated the effects of theta-burst TUS, a protocol shown to increase corticospinal excitability, on the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and functional connectivity. We show that theta-burst TUS in humans selectively reduces GABA levels in the posterior cingulate, but not the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Functional connectivity increased following TUS in both regions. Our findings suggest that TUS changes overall excitability by reducing GABAergic inhibition and that changes in TUS-mediated neuroplasticity last at least 50\,mins after stimulation. The difference in TUS effects on the posterior and anterior cingulate could suggest state- or location-dependency of the TUS effect---both mechanisms increasingly recognized to influence the brain's response to neuromodulation.},

  abstract = {\emph{Objective:} Transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS), with its ability to non-invasively modulate the excitability of region-specific brain areas, is gaining attention as a potential neurotherapeutic modality. The aim of this study was to examine whether or not FUS administered to the brain could alter the extracellular levels of glutamate and {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which are representative excitatory and inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters, respectively. \emph{Methods:} FUS, delivered in the form of a train of pulses, was applied to the thalamus of Sprague-Dawley rats transcranially. Glutamate and GABA were directly sampled from the frontal lobe of the rat brain via a direct microdialysis technique before, during, and after the sonication. The dialysate concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. \emph{Results:} The individual levels of the neurotransmitters sampled were normalized to the baseline level for each rat. In terms of the changes in extracellular glutamate levels, there was no difference between the FUS-treated group and the unsonicated control group. However, extracellular GABA levels started to decrease upon sonication and remained reduced (approximately 20\% below baseline; repeated-measures ANOVA, p {$<$} 0.05, adjusted for multiple comparisons) compared to the control group. \emph{Conclusion:} The ability to modulate region-specific brain activity, along with the present evidence of the ability to modulate neurotransmission, demonstrates the potential utility of FUS as a completely new non-invasive therapeutic modality.},

We used focused ultrasound coupled with fiber photometry to identify optimal neuromodulation parameters for four different arousal centers of the brain in an effort to yield overt changes in behavior. Applying coordinate descent, we found that optimal parameters for excitation or inhibition are highly distinct, the effects of which are generally conserved across brain regions and cell types. Optimized stimulations induced clear, target-specific behavioral effects, whereas non-optimized protocols of equivalent energy resulted in substantially less or no change in behavior. These outcomes were independent of auditory confounds and, contrary to expectation, accompanied by a cyclooxygenase-dependent and prolonged reduction in local blood flow and temperature with brain-region-specific scaling. These findings demonstrate that carefully tuned and targeted ultrasound can exhibit powerful effects on complex behavior and physiology.},

To allow intercomparison between the different modeling tools and techniques used by the community, an international working group was convened to formulate a set of numerical benchmarks. Here, these benchmarks are presented, along with intercomparison results. Nine different benchmarks of increasing geometric complexity are defined. These include a single-layer planar bone immersed in water, a multi-layer bone, and a whole skull. Two transducer configurations are considered (a focused bowl and a plane piston operating at 500\,kHz), giving a total of 18 permutations of the benchmarks. Eleven different modeling tools are used to compute the benchmark results. The models span a wide range of numerical techniques, including the finite-difference time-domain method, angular spectrum method, pseudospectral method, boundary-element method, and spectral-element method. Good agreement is found between the models, particularly for the position, size, and magnitude of the acoustic focus within the skull. When comparing results for each model with every other model in a cross-comparison, the median values for each benchmark for the difference in focal pressure and position are less than 10\% and 1\,mm, respectively. The benchmark definitions, model results, and intercomparison codes are freely available to facilitate further comparisons.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, a handful but growing number of groups have reported worldwide successful low intensity focused ultrasound induced neurostimulation trials on rodents. Its effects range from movement elicitations to reduction of anesthesia time or reduction of the duration of drug induced seizures. The mechanisms underlying ultrasonic neuromodulation are still not fully understood. Given the low intensities used in most of the studies, a mechanical effect is more likely to be responsible for the neuromodulation effect, but a clear description of the thermal and mechanical effects is necessary to optimize clinical applications. Based on five studies settings, we calculated the temperature rise and thermal doses in order to evaluate its implication in the neuromodulation phenomenon. Our retrospective analysis shows thermal rise ranging from 0.002 {$^\circ$}C to 0.8 {$^\circ$}C in the brain for all setups, except for one setup for which the temperature increase is estimated to be as high as 7 {$^\circ$}C. We estimate that in the latter case, temperature rise cannot be neglected as a possible cause of neuromodulation. Simulations results were supported by temperature measurements on a mouse with two different sets of parameters. Although the calculated temperature is compatible with the absence of visible thermal lesions on the skin, it is high enough to impact brain circuits. Our study highlights the usefulness of performing thermal simulations prior to experiment in order to fully take into account not only the impact of the peak intensity but also pulse duration and pulse repetition.},

  abstract = {To understand brain circuits it is necessary both to record and manipulate their activity. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technique. To date, investigations report short-lived neuromodulatory effects, but to deliver on its full potential for research and therapy, ultrasound protocols are required that induce longer-lasting `offline' changes. Here, we present a TUS protocol that modulates brain activation in macaques for more than one hour after 40 s of stimulation, while circumventing auditory confounds. Normally activity in brain areas reflects activity in interconnected regions but TUS caused stimulated areas to interact more selectively with the rest of the brain. In a within-subject design, we observe regionally specific TUS effects for two medial frontal brain regions -- supplementary motor area and frontal polar cortex. Independently of these site-specific effects, TUS also induced signal changes in the meningeal compartment. TUS effects were temporary and not associated with microstructural changes.           ,              Ultrasound is well known for making visible what is hidden, for example, when giving parents a glimpse of their child before birth. But researchers are now using these high-frequency sound waves -- beyond the range of human hearing -- for a wholly different purpose: to manipulate the activity of the brain. Conventional brain stimulation techniques use electric currents or magnetic fields to alter brain activity. These techniques, however, have limitations. They can only reach the surface of the brain and are not particularly precise. By contrast, beams of ultrasound can be focused at a millimetre scale, even deep within the brain. Ultrasound thus has the potential to provide new insights into how the brain works.             Most studies of ultrasound stimulation have looked at what happens to the brain during the stimulation itself. But could ultrasound also induce longer-lasting changes in brain activity? Changes that persist after the stimulation has ended would be valuable for research. They would also make it more likely that we could use ultrasound to treat brain disorders by changing brain activity.             Verhagen, Gallea et al. used a brain scanner to measure brain activity in macaque monkeys after ultrasound stimulation. The results showed that 40 seconds of repetitive ultrasound changed brain activity for up to two hours. Ultrasound caused the stimulated brain area to interact more selectively with the rest of the brain. Notably, only the stimulated area changed its activity in this way. This helps rule out the possibility that the changes reflect non-specific effects. If the monkeys had been able to hear the ultrasound, for example, it would have changed the activity of the parts of the brain related to hearing. Most important of all, the changes were reversible and did not harm the brain.             The results of Verhagen, Gallea et al. show that repetitive ultrasound can induce long-lasting alterations in brain activity. It can target areas deep within the brain, including those that are out of reach with other techniques. If this procedure also shows longer-lasting effects in people, it could yield valuable insights into the links between brain and behaviour. It could also help us develop new treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

However, the skull induces strong aberrations both in phase and amplitude, resulting in a severe degradation of the beam shape. Thus, an efficient brain tumor therapy would require an adaptive focusing, taking into account the effects of the skull. In this paper, we will show that the acoustic properties of the skull can be deduced from high resolution CT scans and used to achieve a noninvasive adaptive focusing. Simulations have been performed with a full 3-D finite differences code, taking into account all the heterogeneities inside the skull. The set of signals to be emitted in order to focus through the skull can thus be computed. The complete adaptive focusing procedure based on prior CT scans has been experimentally validated. This could have promising applications in brain tumor hyperthermia but also in transcranial ultrasonic imaging.},

  abstract = {Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in reward and motivation. Dysfunction in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway has been linked to a variety of psychiatric disorders, including addiction. Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) has demonstrated effects on brain activity, but how LIFU affects dopamine neurotransmission is not known. Here, we applied three different intensities (6.5, 13, and 26 W/cm2 Isppa) of 2-minute LIFU to the prelimbic region (PLC) and measured dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Two minutes of LIFU sonication at 13 W/cm2 to the PLC significantly reduced dopamine release by {\textasciitilde} 50\% for up to 2 hours. However, double the intensity (26 W/cm2) resulted in less inhibition ({\textasciitilde}30\%), and half the intensity (6.5 W/cm2) did not result in any inhibition of dopamine. Anatomical controls applying LIFU to the primary somatosensory cortex did not change NAc core dopamine, and applying LIFU to the PLC did not affect dopamine release in the caudate or NAc shell. Histological evaluations showed no evidence of cell damage or death. Modeling of temperature rise demonstrates a maximum temperature change of 0.5{$^\circ$}C with 13 W/cm2, suggesting that modulation is not due to thermal mechanisms. These studies show that LIFU at a moderate intensity provides a noninvasive, high spatial resolution means to modulate specific mesolimbic circuits that could be used in future studies to target and repair pathways that are dysfunctional in addiction and other psychiatric diseases.},

  abstract = {This Research Topic of Frontiers in Neuroinformatics is dedicated to the memory of Rolf K\&\#246;tter (1961--2010), who was the Frontiers Associate Editor responsible for this Research Topic, and who gave us considerable support and encouragement during the process of conceiving and launching the Topic, and throughout the reviewing process.Computation is becoming essential across all sciences, for data acquisition and analysis, automation, and hypothesis testing via modeling and simulation. As a consequence, software development is becoming a critical scientific activity. Training of scientists in programming, software development, and computational thinking (Wilson, 2006), choice of tools, community-building and interoperability are all issues that should be addressed, if we wish to accelerate scientific progress while maintaining standards of correctness and reproducibility.The Python programming language in particular has seen a surge in popularity across the sciences, for reasons which include its readability, modularity, and large standard library (also see Figure 1). The use of Python as a scientific programming language began to increase with the development of numerical libraries for optimized operations on large arrays in the late 1990s, in which an important development was the merging of the competing Numeric and Numarray packages in 2006 to form NumPy (Oliphant, 2007). As Python and NumPy have gained traction in a given scientific domain, we have seen the emergence of domain-specific ecosystems of open-source Python software developed by scientists. It became clear to us in 2007 that we were on the cusp of an emerging Python in neuroscience ecosystem, particularly in computational neuroscience and neuroimaging, but also in electrophysiological data analysis and in psychophysics. Two major strengths of Python are its modularity and ability to easily ``glue'' together different programming languages, which together facilitate the interaction of modular components and their composition into larger systems. This focus on reusable components, which has proven its value in commercial and open-source software development (Brooks, 1987), is, we contend, essential for scientific computing in neuroscience, if we are to cope with the increasingly large amounts of data being produced in experimental labs, and if we wish to understand and model the brain in all its complexity, We therefore felt that it was timely and important to raise awareness of the emerging Python in Neuroscience software ecosystem amongst researchers developing Python-based tools, but also in the larger neuroscience community. Our goals were several-fold:- establish a critical mass for Python use and development in the eyes of the community;- encourage interoperability and collaboration between developers;- expose neuroscientists to the new Python-based tools now available.From this was born the idea for a Research Topic in Frontiers in Neuroinformatics on ``Python in Neuroscience'' to showcase those projects we were aware of, and to give exposure to projects of which we were not aware. Although it may seem strange at first glance to centre a Research Topic around a tool, rather than around a scientific problem, we feel it is justified by the increasingly critical role of scientific programming in neuroscience research, and by the particular strengths of the Python language and the broader Python scientific computing ecosystem.Collected in this Research Topic are 24 articles describing some ways in which neuroscience researchers around the world are turning to the Python programming language to get their job done faster and more efficiently.[Figure 1 around here]Figure 1.

Reproduced under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 License (see http://xkcd.com/license.html)Overview of the Research TopicWe will now briefly summarize the 24 articles in the Research Topic, drawing out common themes.Both Southey et al. (2008) and Yanashima et al. (2009) use Python for bioinformatics applications, but in very different areas. Yanashima et al. have developed a Python package for graph-theoretical analysis of biomolecular networks, BioNetpy, and employed it to investigate protein networks associated with Alzheimer's disease. Southey et al.'s study demonstrates the wide breadth of application of Python, and the large number of high quality scientific libraries available, combining existing tools for bioinformatics, machine learning and web development to build an integrated pipeline for identification of prohormone precursors and prediction of prohormone cleavage sites.Jurica and van Leeuwen (2009) address the needs of scientists who already have significant amounts of code written in MATLAB\&\#174; and who wish to transfer this to Python. They present OMPC, which uses syntax adaptation and emulation to allow transparent import of existing MATLAB\&\#174; functions into Python programs. Three articles reported on new tools in the domain of neuroimaging. Hanke et al. (2009) report on PyMVPA, a Python framework for machine learning-based data analysis, and its application to analysis of fMRI, EEG, MEG, and extracellular electrophysiology recordings. Gouws et al. (2009) describe DataViewer3D, a Python application for displaying and integrating data from multiple neuroimaging modalities, showcasing Python's abilities to easily interface with libraries written in other languages, such as C++, and to integrate them into user-friendly systems. Strangman et al. (2009) emphasize the advantages of Python for ``swift prototyping followed by efficient transition to stable production systems'' in their description of NinPy, a toolkit for near-infrared neuroimaging.Zito et al. (2009) and Ince et al. (2009) both report on the use of Python for general purpose data analysis, with a focus on machine learning and information theory respectively. Zito et al. have developed MDP, the Modular toolkit for Data Processing, a collection of computationally efficient data analysis modules that can be combined into complex pipelines. MDP was originally developed for theoretical research in neuroscience, but has broad application in general scientific data analysis and in teaching. Ince et al. (2009) describe the use of Python for information-theoretic analysis of neuroscience data, outlining algorithmic, statistical and numerical challenges in the application of information theory in neuroscience, and explaining how the use of Python has significantly improved the speed and domain of applicability of the algorithms, allowing more ambitious analyses of more complex data sets. Their code is available as an open-source package, pyEntropy.Three articles report on tools for visual stimulus generation, for use in visual neurophysiology and psychophysics experiments. Straw (2008) describes VisionEgg, while Peirce (2009) presents PsychoPy, both of which are easy-to-use and easy-to-install applications that make use of OpenGL to generate temporally and spatially precise, arbitrarily complex visual stimulation protocols. Python is used to provide a simple, intuitive interface to the underlying graphics libraries, to provide a graphical user interface, and to interface with external hardware. PsychoPy can also generate and deliver auditory stimuli. Spacek et al. (2009) also report on a Python library for visual stimulus generation, as part of a toolkit for the acquisition and analysis of highly parallel electrophysiological recordings from cat and rat visual cortex. The other two components in the toolkit are for electrophysiological waveform visualization and spike sorting; and for spike train and stimulus analysis. The authors note ``The requirements and solutions for these projects differed greatly, yet we found Python to be well suited for all three.'' Also in the domain of electrophysiology, Garcia and Fourcaud-Trocm\&\#233; (2009) describe OpenElectrophy, an application for efficient storage and analysis of large electrophysiology datasets, which includes a graphical user interface for interactive visualization and exploration and a library of analysis routines, including several spike-sorting methods.By far the largest contribution to the Research Topic came from the field of modelling and simulation, with 12 articles on the topic. Nine of these articles present neuroscience simulation environments with Python scripting interfaces. In most cases, the Python interface was added to an existing simulator written in a compiled language such as C++. This was the case for NEURON (Hines et al., 2009), NEST (Eppler et al., 2009), PCSIM (Pecevski et al., 2009), Nengo (Stewart et al., 2009), MOOSE (Ray and Bhalla, 2008), STEPS (Wils and De Schutter, 2009) and NCS (Drewes et al., 2009). However, as the articles by Goodman and Brette (2008) on the Brian simulator and Bednar (2009) on the Topographica simulator demonstrate, it is also possible to develop new simulation environments purely in Python, making use of the vectorization techniques available in the underlying NumPy package to obtain computational efficiency. The range of modelling domains of these simulators is wide, from stochastic simulation of coupled reaction-diffusion systems (STEPS), through simulation of morphologically detailed neurons and networks (NEURON, MOOSE), highly-efficient large-scale networks of spiking point neurons (NEST, PCSIM, NCS, Brian) to population coding or point-neuron models of large brain regions (Nengo, Topographica). Note that although we have categorized each simulator by its main area of application, most of these tools support modelling at a range of scales and levels of detail: Bednar (2009), for example, describes the integration of a spiking NEST simulation as one component in a Topographica simulation.The addition of Python interfaces to such a large number of widely used simulation environments suggested a huge opportunity to enhance interoperability between different simulators, making use of the common scripting language, which in turn has the potential to enhance the transfer of technology, knowledge and models between users of the different simulators, and to promote model reuse. Davison et al. (2009) describe PyNN, a common Python interface to multiple simulators, which enables the same modelling and simulation script to be run on any supported simulator without modification. At the time of writing, PyNN supports NEURON, NEST, PCSIM and Brian, with MOOSE support under development. The existence of such a common ``meta-simulator'' then makes it much easier for scientists developing new, hardware-based approaches to neural simulation to engage with the computational neuroscience community, as evidenced by the article by Br\&\#252;derle et al. (2009) on interfacing a novel neuromorphic hardware system with PyNN.Finally, Fox et al. (2009) describe the possibilities when one is not limited to a single simulator, but can use Python to integrate multiple models into a brain-wide system. In their development of an integrated basal ganglia-hippocampal formation model for spatial navigation and its embodiment in a simulated robotic environment, Fox et al. found that Python offers ``a significant reduction in development time, without a corresponding significant increase in execution time''.It is important to note that most or all of the Python tools and libraries described in the Research Topic are open source and hence free to download, use and extend.DiscussionThis editorial is being written six years after the first articles in the Research Topic were published. It is with the benefit of considerable hindsight, therefore, that we can confidently say that our goals in launching this Research Topic -- to establish a critical mass for Python use and development in the eyes of the community and to encourage interoperability and collaboration between developers -- have been met or exceeded.The average number of citations per article for the Research Topic as a whole is 54, or approximately 9 per year, using figures from Google Scholar. Although citation counts from Google Scholar tend to be higher than those from Journal Citation Reports so the numbers are not directly comparable, this compares favourably with the impact factors of well respected journals such as Journal of Neuroscience or PLoS Computational Biology. Some of the articles were much more highly cited, with three of them being cited more than 20 times per year, on average, over the period. Four of the articles were chosen to ``climb the tier'' in the Frontiers system, and were followed up by Focused Review articles in Frontiers in Neuroscience (Davison, Hines and Muller, 2009; Goodman and Brette, 2009; Hanke et al., 2010; Ince et al., 2010), another was the subject of a commentary (Einevoll, 2009). Concerning the goals of interoperability and collaboration, several articles in a follow-up volume Python in Neuroscience II attest to the degree to which the developers of different tools have worked together, and prioritized interoperability in recent years. For example, the developers of OpenElectrophy (Garcia and Fourcaud-Trocm\&\#233;, 2009) and the community around PyNN (Davison et al., 2009) formed the nucleus of an effort to develop a baseline Python representation for electrophysiology data, which resulted in the Neo project, reported in the Python in Neuroscience II Research Topic (Garcia et al., 2014) together with two of the several projects which build on Neo (Pr\&\#246;pper and Obermayer, 2013; Sobolev et al., 2014). A new workflow system for computational neuroscience, Mozaik (Antol\&\#237;k and Davison, 2014) builds on both PyNN and Topographica (Bednar, 2009). PyNEST (Eppler et al., 2009) and PyNN developers collaborated with the INCF to improve the interoperability between these tools (Djurfeldt et al., 2014) when using the Connection Set Algebra (Djurfeldt, 2010). Finally, a number of tools have been built on the Python interface to NEURON (Hines et al., 2009), including morphforge (Hull and Willshaw, 2014) and LFPy (Lind\&\#233;n et al., 2014).Observing the rapid growth in adoption of Python in neuroscience over the last six years, which appears to continue to accelerate, it is clear that Python is here to stay, which augurs well for the growth, productivity, and rigour of computational methods in neuroscience.},

  abstract = {Neuroscientists routinely perform experiments aimed at recording or manipulating neural activity, uncovering physiological processes underlying brain function or elucidating aspects of brain anatomy. Understanding how the brain generates behaviour ultimately depends on merging the results of these experiments into a unified picture of brain anatomy and function. Brain atlases are crucial in this endeavour: by outlining the organization of brain regions they provide a reference upon which our understanding of brain function can be anchored. More recently, digital high-resolution 3d atlases have been produced for several model organisms providing an invaluable resource for the research community. Effective use of these atlases depends on the availability of an application programming interface (API) that enables researchers to develop software to access and query atlas data. However, while some atlases come with an API, these are generally specific for individual atlases, and this hinders the development and adoption of open-source neuroanatomy software. The BrainGlobe atlas API (BG-Atlas API) overcomes this problem by providing a common interface for programmers to download and process data across a variety of model organisms. By adopting the BG-Atlas API, software can then be developed agnostic to the atlas, increasing adoption and interoperability of packages in neuroscience and enabling direct integration of different experimental modalities and even comparisons across model organisms.},

Affine transformations from strings syntax
------------------------------------------

Throughtout the sofware - in the GUI or configuration dictionaries - transformations of 3D objects can be defined by the user as ``strings``.

The syntax supports:

* Translation
    * ``Tx50um`` (translate 50 micrometers along :math:`x`)
* Rotate:
    * ``Rz12deg`` (12 degree rotation around :math:`z` axis)
* Scale
    * ``S0.2`` (apply a 0.2 scaling ratio in all directions)
    * ``Sy30`` (apply a 30 scaling ratio along :math:`y`)
